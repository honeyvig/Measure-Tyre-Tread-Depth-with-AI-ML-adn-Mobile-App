# Measure-Tyre-Tread-Depth-with-AI-ML-adn-Mobile-App
Make an mobile application (iOS or Android) using which we can take images of car tyre or generate 3D Model of car tyre using ARkit and then measure treatment depth to check quality of tyres.

Will need accurate tyre tread depth with accuracy of less then 0.1 mm.

Overall purpose is to use mobile app to avoid manually checking tyre treatment depth.
-------------
Creating a mobile application that uses ARKit (for iOS) or ARCore (for Android) to capture the tread depth of a car tire and accurately measure it requires leveraging computer vision, augmented reality (AR), and some form of 3D modeling. Below is an outline of how such an app can be structured, focusing on key functionalities like image capturing, depth measurement, and creating a 3D model. Since this app requires high accuracy (less than 0.1 mm), we must ensure precision with advanced image processing and AR depth calculation techniques.
Key Features of the Application:

    Image Capture of Car Tire:
        Use the camera to capture images of the tire tread.
        Automatically detect the tire's surface for measurement.

    3D Model Generation Using AR:
        Utilize ARKit (iOS) or ARCore (Android) to generate a 3D model of the tire tread.
        Display real-time tire depth calculation while visualizing the tire's tread.

    Tread Depth Measurement:
        Calculate the tire tread depth (thickness) with a level of precision under 0.1 mm.
        Use AR to overlay a virtual ruler or measurement tool on the surface of the tire.

    Real-time Feedback:
        Show users the tread depth and whether the tire needs replacing based on standard depth thresholds.
        Display results on the screen in real-time with both visual and numerical representations.

    Data Storage:
        Store the measurement results and history of checks for future reference.

Suggested Tools and Technologies:

    ARKit (for iOS) or ARCore (for Android): For AR and camera-based depth measurements.
    CoreML and Vision (for iOS): For image processing and detecting tire tread surface.
    TensorFlow or PyTorch (for Android/iOS): For object detection and measurement extraction.
    SceneKit or RealityKit (for iOS) / ARCore 3D models (for Android): To create the 3D models of the tire.
    Swift (for iOS) / Kotlin (for Android): For native mobile app development.

Below is a conceptual example of the implementation process and code snippets for iOS (ARKit) using Swift. The Android version would follow a similar structure using ARCore.
iOS Application Example Using ARKit
Step 1: Set up ARKit and Camera for Image Capture

First, we need to set up an AR session using ARKit to capture the car tire's tread and later create a 3D model for measuring depth.

import UIKit
import ARKit

class TireMeasurementViewController: UIViewController, ARSCNViewDelegate {

    @IBOutlet var sceneView: ARSCNView!
    @IBOutlet var measurementLabel: UILabel!
    
    var lastMeasuredDepth: Float = 0.0
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        sceneView.delegate = self
        
        // Configure the AR session
        let configuration = ARWorldTrackingConfiguration()
        sceneView.session.run(configuration)
    }
    
    // Function to detect tire tread and measure depth
    func measureTireDepthFromImage(image: UIImage) {
        // Use image processing and AR to detect the tread and compute depth
        // This is where you'd integrate machine learning to assess tread depth.
        
        // Example: calculate depth here, potentially by detecting features in the image.
        // For simplicity, we'll simulate a depth value.
        
        let depth = Float.random(in: 1.5..<4.0)  // Simulate some depth value for demonstration
        lastMeasuredDepth = depth
        measurementLabel.text = "Tire Depth: \(depth) mm"
    }

    // Add AR features (e.g., adding virtual measurement ruler over the tire)
    func addMeasurementTool() {
        // Add AR model to measure depth (for illustration purposes)
        let measurementTool = SCNNode(geometry: SCNSphere(radius: 0.05))
        measurementTool.position = SCNVector3(0, 0, -0.5)
        sceneView.scene.rootNode.addChildNode(measurementTool)
    }
    
    // Function to handle AR session updates
    func renderer(_ renderer: SCNSceneRenderer, updateAtTime time: TimeInterval) {
        // Update AR session and handle any depth-related logic in this function
    }
    
    // Function to handle the AR session's error or interruption
    func session(_ session: ARSession, didFailWithError error: Error) {
        print("AR Session failed with error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    }
}

Step 2: Image Recognition and Depth Measurement

In this step, we use Vision or CoreML (or TensorFlow Lite for iOS) to analyze the tire tread image and extract depth measurements. This could include using a pre-trained model to detect tread patterns and compute depth. For instance, a custom-trained model could take in images of the tire tread and output a depth estimate.

Here’s an example of how to use Vision to detect objects in the image, and later measure depth:

import Vision

func analyzeTireImage(image: UIImage) {
    guard let cgImage = image.cgImage else { return }
    
    // Create a request to detect the tire tread
    let request = VNCoreMLRequest(model: yourCustomModel) { request, error in
        if let results = request.results as? [VNRecognizedObjectObservation] {
            for result in results {
                // Process the detected objects (tread)
                print("Detected object: \(result.labels)")
                
                // Example: Measure depth based on object size or other heuristic
                let depthEstimate = calculateDepthFromObject(result)
                DispatchQueue.main.async {
                    self.measurementLabel.text = "Estimated Tread Depth: \(depthEstimate) mm"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Perform the request on the image
    let handler = VNImageRequestHandler(cgImage: cgImage, options: [:])
    try? handler.perform([request])
}

func calculateDepthFromObject(_ observation: VNRecognizedObjectObservation) -> Float {
    // Implement logic to estimate depth based on object size or heuristic
    return Float.random(in: 1.5..<4.0) // Example
}

Step 3: Generate a 3D Model and Overlay on Tire Using ARKit

Using ARKit, we can visualize the measured depth over the tire in a 3D space. You can add an AR object (such as a virtual measurement ruler) that dynamically adjusts based on the detected tread depth.

func create3DModelForTireTread() {
    // Create a simple 3D model (a ruler, for example) to measure the tire tread depth
    let depthMeasurementNode = SCNNode(geometry: SCNCylinder(radius: 0.1, height: CGFloat(lastMeasuredDepth)))
    depthMeasurementNode.position = SCNVector3(0, 0, -0.5)  // Position it relative to the tire
    sceneView.scene.rootNode.addChildNode(depthMeasurementNode)
}

Step 4: Calibration and Accuracy Measurement

Since you require a depth measurement accuracy of less than 0.1 mm, you may need to calibrate the camera and depth measurement system accurately. This can be done by capturing the tread in high resolution and using computer vision algorithms to process the tire tread with extremely high precision.

You can also use LIDAR (on supported devices) to enhance depth measurements, achieving greater precision in measuring small objects like tire tread.
Android Application Using ARCore (Similar Structure)

For Android, you would use ARCore and TensorFlow Lite for object detection and depth measurements.

    ARCore can be used to create 3D models of the tire.
    TensorFlow Lite or OpenCV can be used for image processing to measure tread depth from the captured images.

Here’s a rough approach for an Android app:

    Use ARCore to place virtual models over the tire.
    Use TensorFlow Lite for tire tread detection.
    Overlay depth measurement tools using ARCore's 3D capabilities.

Conclusion

This app involves using both ARKit (for iOS) or ARCore (for Android), combined with machine learning (CoreML or TensorFlow Lite) to measure and display accurate tire tread depth. The app will allow users to easily check their tire tread depth without manual measurements. Additionally, further calibration and high-precision depth detection algorithms will be required to achieve the accuracy of less than 0.1 mm, especially when dealing with small features like tire tread depth.
